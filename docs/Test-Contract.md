# Chippyash Assembler Builder Pattern

## 
      chippyash\Test\Assembler\Assembler
    

*  You cannot construct an assembler directly
*  You construct an assembler using the create method
*  You can release multiple values
*  You can release just a single value
*  Releasing multiple values will return them in the order specified
*  Creating a variable expects a closure
*  Assembling the assembler returns the assembler
*  You can get a singleton instance of the assembler
*  You cannot overwrite a previously assembled value
*  You can merge two assemblies
*  You can send in parameters when you create an assembler
*  You can send in parameters when you get an assembler
*  Parameters sent in during creation are immutable

## 
      chippyash\Test\Assembler\FFor
    

*  You cannot construct a singleton ffor
*  You cannot merge a ffor
*  You can fyield a ffor instead of assemble then return
